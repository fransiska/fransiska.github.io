I used to use [PlainText](http://433labs.com) long time ago. I just found out that they stop the support and somehow I couldn't find it in the AppStore. I was looking for an alternative, and found [this awesome site](http://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/) which lists all iOS Text Editors.

After trying several stuff, I found [UpWord](http://www.upwordnotes.com). It syncs to an Apps folder in Dropbox smoothly, including deleting files and adding files through and from other computer. It has this cool swipe gesture to change the format of a line. Awesome. It seems to have a reminder function as well, but being able to edit the text is enough for me.
