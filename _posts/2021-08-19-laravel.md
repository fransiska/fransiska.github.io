### Introduction

- Goal: Learn about Laravel database (Migration, Deletion)
- System: Ubuntu 16.04 (Yes it's old)

### Installation


```bash
sudo apt-get install php5.6 # Yes it's old... Might need to install something else
sudo apt install mysql-server
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

- I forgot what's the exact installation and setup for mysql
- Composer is used to create the laravel project

### Start a basic Laravel

- Install, download necessary stuff and create a new folder with the project content

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel php-laravel-example
cd php-laravel-example
php artisan serve # Yay!
```

- `artisan` is a tool supplied with the laravel, it helps to build up the application
- Note that the one below is for use with Docker, so I'm not using it

```bash
curl -s "https://laravel.build/php-laravel-example" | bash
```

### Connecting Laravel to MySQL

- You can create a custom user to be used with the database

```sql
CREATE USER 'sammy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'sammy'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

- Edit the project folder's `.env` file with the mysql credentials
- Run the mysql server

```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
```

- And then login using this, password will be prompted

```bash
mysql -u sammy -p
```

### Creating a Model

- Laravel includes Eloquent (ORM) and we use `Model` to interact with the database
- This will create `app/Flight.php`

```bash
php artisan make:model Flight
```

- If we want the instance to have soft delete (ie. when deleted it doesn't actually get deleted from the table), we can import `use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;` and put `use SoftDeletes;` inside the model file

### Create a new Table

```bash
php artisan make:migration create_flights_table
```

- The above will create a file inside `database/migrations`
- We can edit the files to add in the table columns
    ```php
    Schema::create('flights', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->increments('id');
        $table->string('name');
        $table->string('airline');
        $table->softDeletes(); // This is to enable usage of soft delete by creating the necessary column (deleted_at)
        $table->timestamps();
    });
    ```
- After creating the migration file, we can check the migration status by `php artisan migrate:status` then run it with `php artisan migrate`
- In case something is not right, we can undo the migration by `php artisan migrate:rollback` (Given that the migration file has enough code to roll back itself)

### Add new data
- We can use the supplied `php artisan tinker` to "tinker" with the application
- However, we cannot add a new data like this by default since the Model by default is protected
```php
$flightData = array('name' => 'JAL123', 'airline' => 'Japan Airlines');
Flight::create($flightData);
```
- By putting `protected $guarded = [];` inside the Model file, we can then successfully add a new row (Adding this line requires tinker to be restarted)
```php
>>> Flight::count()
=> 1
```

### Deleting data

- If we delete the data `Flight::find(1)->delete()`, `Flight::count()` becomes 0
- The row still exists, but now the `deleted_at` column is filled
- We can restore is by `Flight::withTrashed()->find(1)->restore()`


### Maintenance View

```php
php artisan down
php artisan up
```

Neat!
