I've only been using Python for the last 3.5 years. It's a very easy to use language that I thought it's not that deep. But turns out (of course) there are a bunch of stuff that I didn't know! Like:
- Setter and getter (with `@property` and `@x.setter`)
- The use of underscore to make some attribute somewhat private (I thought it's just for indication), mangling
    ```python
    obj1.__fun = None # Does not give error
    obj1.__fun()      # Error because it's private
    obj1._Base__fun() # mangling
    ```
- Magic functions
  ```python
  def __init__(self):
	  # Called after object creation
	  pass
  def __new__(cls):
	  # Called when an object is created, actually returns the instance
	  return super(ClsTest, cls).__new__(cls)
  ```
- It is possible to change a class attribute in a static method, the difference with a class method is whether the class is automatically passed or not (the `cls`)
  ```python
  class A:
	  x = 1
	  
	  @staticmethod
	  def static_method():
		  A.x = 2
		  
	  @classmethod
	  def class_method(cls):
	      cls.x = 3
  ```
