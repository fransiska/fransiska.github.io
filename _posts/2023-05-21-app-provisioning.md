In order for your app to be installable in iOS device, it needs provisioning, some kind of validating that the app comes from where it says, something like https certificate, to my understanding. There are different types of provisioning ([ref](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/91519)):

- (Free) Expires in one week
- (Paid) TestFlight expires 90 days
- (Paid) ad-hoc expires in one year max
