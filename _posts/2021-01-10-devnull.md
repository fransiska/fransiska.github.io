Since the `import` lines in python can take several seconds (in Raspberry Pi), it's better to just use a simple bash when trying to do simple stuff.

In bash scripts, I often see `/dev/null` but never really sure what it's used for. 
Also, there's a lot of different `>` like  `2>/dev/null` or `&> /dev/null` or `> /dev/null 2>&1` etc.

`/dev/null` is basically a way to suppress output. `1` refers to `stdout`, and `2` refers to `stderr`. Basically `&> /dev/null` a new syntax for `> /dev/null 2>&1`. 

Example:
- `ls` by itself will show the result in terminal
- `ls 1> /dev/null` will **not** show the result in terminal
- `ls 2> /dev/null` will show the result in terminal
- `ls &> /dev/null` will **not** show the result in terminal
- `ls -0 1> /dev/null` will show the error in terminal
- `ls -0 2> /dev/null` will **not** show the error in terminal
- `ls -0 &> /dev/null` will **not** show the error in terminal

`echo $?` is a neat way to get the result of previously executed command, `0` when succeeded, and `1` when failed.

Example:
- `ping -c 1 google.com &> /dev/null; echo $?` will print out 0 if the ping succeeded.

Another useful thing when debugging a script run with cron is to echo to journal. By `echo 'Debug' | /usr/bin/systemd-cat` we can see the echoed line in `journalctl -f`. And do not to forget to add `#!/bin/bash` at the beginning of the bash script file.
