NFS provides no encryption (fast) file sharing in local network.

### Server

```bash
sudo nano /etc/exports
```

Add line

```
/full/path 192.168.1.0/24(rw,insecure,no_subtree_check,all_squash,anongid=0,anonuid=0)
```

- `all_squash,anongid=0,anonuid=0` is required to enable creating file regardless of the user (I think) without it file (with root owner?) cannot be copied

Then

```bash
sudo exportfs -ra  # Apply change
showmount -e 192.168.1.2  # Check mounts
```

### Client

```bash
sudo apt install nfs-common
sudo mkdir /mnt/mounting_folder
sudo mount -o v3 192.168.1.2:/full/path /mnt/mounting_folder
```

To retain the change after reboot, put in fstab

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Add line

```
192.168.1.2:/full/path /mnt/mounting_folder nfs defaults 0 0
```
